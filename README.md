# Reddit Stress Detection using NLP

## Project Overview
This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze Reddit posts and classify whether a user is stressed or not.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of Reddit posts labeled as:
- 0: Stressed
- 1: Not Stressed

## Methodology
- Text cleaning (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Train-test split
- Model training using Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 74%, with balanced performance across both classes.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- nltk
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
